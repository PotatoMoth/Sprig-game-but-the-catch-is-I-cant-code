This is my first time actually coding anything. 
You can get the game at sprig.hackclub.com in the gallery under the name "HELP ME I CANT CODE". The game should probally be played on a sprig if you have one, but if you don't you can play it in your browser on a computer.
I have only enough coding knowledge to struggle through making this game, and not much else. I hope to one day be better, but I am satisfied with my progress so far.
Anyway, I'll keep this short. Enjoy the game :)
